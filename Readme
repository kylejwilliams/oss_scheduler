To Run Program:
---------------
This program takes 5 optional command line arguments as follows:
    -h, --help  displays a help message
    -q          specify a value for the quantum in ns
                DEFAULT: 10 ms
    -t          specify the amount of time the program should run in s
                DEFAULT: 30 s
    -f          specify the file to save program output
                DEFAULT: out.log
    -p          specify the processes run time
                DEFAULT: 50 ms

After execution, a file will be generated in the program's calling directory
containing output for the program. The output shows the how the child processes
have been scheduled over the given duration. It records things such as when new
processes have been generated, when a process is given priority of the queue,
when the process is dispatched from the queue, when a process has finished executing,
and finally a summary of the average wait time and average turnover rate of the
processes.

Special notes:
--------------
-- multilevel queue has not been implemented, just the round robin
-- for some reason when execution is finished the line 'Putting process with PID
    x into queue 1'. This is because of how it handles clearing the processes
    when executing has concluded
